# Iris Flower Dataset Analysis and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves the analysis and application of machine learning algorithms on the famous Iris Flower dataset. The following steps were undertaken to accomplish this:

   Data Loading:
   - The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further exploration and analysis.

   Data Exploration:
   - Explored the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
   - Reported the number of data points and features.

   Data Visualization:
   - Utilized Matplotlib to visualize some sample images from the dataset.

   Data Preprocessing:
   - Preprocessed the dataset, which included tasks such as splitting, scaling, and normalizing.

   Model Training:
   - Trained Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree algorithms on the dataset.

   Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Applied hyperparameter tuning techniques to select the best hyperparameters for each model.
   - Selected the best model of each type.
     
    Training Performance Evaluation:
   - Evaluated the training performance on the train data, generating confusion matrices, and computing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

   Test Performance Evaluation:
   - Evaluated the results on the test data, generating confusion matrices and computing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Utilized bootstrapping to measure average accuracy/precision/recall and their 95% confidence interval.

    Model Comparison:
    - Compared the training and test results of each model, paying attention to potential overfitting or underfitting.
    - Selected the best-performing model.
